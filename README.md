The goal is to build a **machine learning model** that estimates house prices based on user input.

### Key Steps:

- Clean and preprocess data
- Engineer useful features (e.g. price per square foot)
- Remove outliers
- Train a regression model
- Optimize with GridSearchCV
- Save the model using `joblib` for deployment
